-Have you found your passion? I'm still looking for mine.

-You know, this isn't my first game. 

-What game was it, you ask? I'd, uhh, rather not talk about it. Let's just say you'll probably never play it. Went to the cutting room floor where it belongs.

-Can you guess where the player was supposed to shoot me? That's right, these massive orbs on my face. What were they thinking?

-I tried telling them there was no way I'd pose a threat to the player, and they gave me some BS about how I was an "early game boss." What a crock.

-The designer of the game I came from, let me tell you, he was clueless. Only let me use a handful of moves so the player wouldn't get "confused."

-*attempts to whistle* ...sorry, I won't try that again.

-*attempts to whistle again, stops self*

-*hums a song out of key*

-So, here's the thing about Blackjack. Casinos have got this figured out; it's one of the fairest games they have.

-The reason I picked up Blackjack was that my previous game just wasn't fair. Instantly the player seemed to know how to beat me. I was sick of it.

-Occasionally I did have a player who didn't get the hint. Didn't see these...things on my face. Somehow.

-How can you NOT see these massive glowing spheres? Like, are you kidding me? But occasionally those players did, in fact, exist.

-*starts coughing, voice shifts to normal before shifting back* Ahem, excuse me

-------------------------

-So, uhh, that's all I have to say about that. Thanks for playing with me.
