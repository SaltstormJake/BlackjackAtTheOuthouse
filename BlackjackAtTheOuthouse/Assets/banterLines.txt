-Have you seen the weather outside? Real rough, real rough.

-Yeah, things have never been the same since the calamity, eh?

-So, what did you do before things hit the fan a few years back?

-What did I do before the calamity? It's a long story.

-I was actually a, uhh, boss battle. What's the game name? You probably wouldn't have played it.

-Did I like my job? It was okay. Got my ass kicked a lot, I had a pretty obvious weak spot. *points at eyes*

-I wasn't happy about it, but hey, the pay was good. And it's not like anything hurts. Look at this: *breaks hand* see?

-Seems like games nowadays are moving away from boss battles. Maybe it was for the best I retired.

-I guess that isn't a very long story, eh? I was wrong.

-So, uhh, that's all I have to say about that. Thanks for playing with me.
